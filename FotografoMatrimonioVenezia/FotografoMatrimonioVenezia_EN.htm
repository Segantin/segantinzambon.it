        		<h1>Emotionally closer to the Spouses. </h1>
       	 		<p>
                We like to be "close" to the spouses and to what happens in that particular family event in order to enter into communication with what we want to communicate with the photography. So we live the wedding as guests but with discretion.

      		<h1>
				What excitement to take pictures! 
				</h1>
       		<p>The photographer will be hardly able to communicate something if  he is not transported within the reality he wants to portray. 
If I want to portray well a child, I have to be a child and think like a child, I have to make me like him. 

If I want to portray a philosopher I will try to live his deep inner work. 
For this reason we get involved emotionally from the photos we do because, otherwise, they would be images without a soul. It is not uncommon for us then, during the various stages of a service, to be moved.

        	<h1>To make himself alike to see</h1>
			<p>Plotinus: "To any vision must be brought an eye adapted to what is to be seen, and having some likeness to it. Never did eye see the sun unless it had first become sunlike, and never can the soul have vision of the First Beauty unless itself be beautiful. "Enneadi- 250d.c. </p>

			<h1>See with the eyes? </h1>
       		<p>Sometimes we can think that our eyes are enough to see, without noticing our own littleness. 
  "If a man lives based only on what he physically sees, he falls into a deep blindness. 
Then he limits his horizon to the point that he can't catch the essential. "J.R.
