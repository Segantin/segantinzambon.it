   	What do you offer? 
    </div>
      <div class="testosito">
       <p>We offer our passion for photography multiplied by two: 
       </p>
       <p> we are a company of two Tau Visual professional photographers, Segantin Gianfranco and Sara Zambon, unlike many companies formed by individual photographers, and so we often work in pair offering a job doubly professional and with a more complete view of your wedding. 
Along with the photo shoot in DVD with high resolution images placed by professional software, we can also deliver a DVD with a selection of images in a musical slide show for the video. Our most requested service, however, is the creation of  the album. The wedding Album is a summary of the entire photo shoot and is one of the few important things that will remain over time, making us relive that wonderful day. It is not enough take good pictures, you have to also compose them well, according to our style, in an orderly and elegant way. Be followed with professionalism from the start of the service until the composition of the Album is important: this creates a unique work, as much as every couple is. 
Among other things, we can also deliver a nice USB stick with the presentation in Flash of the finished Album, easy to carry and to share. But innovations in the service run faster than the updating of the site, so you can know the latest news by contacting us directly.

	<div class="testositopiccoloB">How can we describe the most of your wedding from the photographic point of view? 
	</div>
	<div class="testosito">
		<p>To tell a good story you have to live it.</p>
		<p> As we often say, we try to live the most important day of your wedding as guests, but with discretion. 
This always creates a deep relationship with what is happening that magical day because we experience it with you. 
Every couple is rich of unique and precious love, every married couple live a different story, each couple is called to a unique path. 
It's still love, but it's always a different, special, unique kind of love: it's your love. 
The beautiful photography makes it eternal. 
</p>
	</div>
	<div class="testositopiccoloB">
		What style do you use? </div>
	<div class="testosito">
        <p> We work emotionally involved with sensitivity and artistic creativity, to pursue exciting and original images of your wedding. We normally use the style reportage adding artistic photos and, on request, also pictures in natural pose. From the relaxed and smiling faces of our spouses you can understand much. 
As far as possible, with discretion, we try to know something about the personality of the couple and the guests, as each pictures shouldn't be detached and cold but should have its own history. 
</p>
    </div>
        
	<div class="testositopiccoloB">What is your philosophy? 
    </div>
    
 	<div class="testosito">     
       <p>Today we travel upstream because in an era where marriage loses its value, we believe more and more in the values of marriage and the family. 
We believe in marriage as a gift and commitment. Start and continuation of a journey of love, fertile of  trust, hope, joy and openness to others. We try to achieve the essential, the simplicity, the emotion, the new and  the old  all together in every picture, starting from the wealth of every special union because every wedding is unique. The beautiful photography creates emotions, searches the eternal values, enriches the quality time on which are based the important moments of your lives. 
</p>
   </div>   
      
   <div class="testositopiccoloB">What kind of album you compose? 
   </div>
	<div class="testosito">
		<p>We essentially compose three types of album: our Photo Album (with the partnership of an unique artisan company of high quality), a traditional Album and a particular Album with a delicate passepartout eventually accompanied with prints in Digigraphie®. As a new product some containers are also made with the photos mounted on separate card-boards. </p>
	</div>
    <div class="testositopiccoloB"Is possible to compose the album if we live far away? 
    </div>

Definitely yes. Today the far away doesn't exists anymore, both because there is the web, and because many transport systems are efficient. We execute and deliver album in Italy and abroad (A lot of foreigners get married in Venice). We carry out the layout and graphics of the album but the selection of photos is possible to do it together through the web with a personal page, or by using test paper directly to the home of the couple. Every week we visit around the Veneto. Nothing is left to chance to get a unique and personalized product. The rate of satisfaction we can say that is more than 100% because it is normal for us to try to exceed the expectations of customers.
</p>
	</div>
    <div class="testositopiccoloB">Where do you work? 
    </div>
    <div class="testosito">   
       <p>We work primarily in Veneto but, after evaluation, we can work in other parts of Italy and abroad. </p>
	</div>
 	<div class="testositopiccoloB">Especially Weddings? 
    </div>
    <div class="testosito">   
       <p>Yes, our work is aimed especially at marriages, this does not exclude that our experience and sensitivity gained over the years puts us as professionals prepared photographically for services of all kinds. This is why major companies like Fly Emirates, Procter & Gamble, Axa, General Electrics, Edison, Mionetto, Sony, Eiuc ... and many agencies require our service for different photographic works.
